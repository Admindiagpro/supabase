## Building the app

Let's start building the Angular app from scratch using Angular 19's modern features.

### Initialize an Angular app

We can use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) to initialize
an app called `angular-user-management`:

```bash
npx @angular/cli@latest new angular-user-management --routing --style css --standalone
cd angular-user-management
```

<Admonition type="note">

Angular 19 uses standalone components by default, which simplifies the development experience and reduces boilerplate code. This tutorial will use the modern standalone approach throughout.

</Admonition>

Then let's install the only additional dependency: [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

And finally we want to save the environment variables in the `src/environments/environment.ts` file.
All we need are the API URL and the `anon` key that you copied [earlier](#get-the-api-keys).
These variables will be exposed on the browser, and that's completely fine since we have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on our Database.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/environments/environment.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/environments/environment.ts"
/>

Now that we have the API credentials in place, let's create a `SupabaseService` with `ng g s supabase` to initialize the Supabase client and implement functions to communicate with the Supabase API.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/supabase.service.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/supabase.service.ts"
/>

Optionally, update [src/styles.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/angular-user-management/src/styles.css) to style the app.

### Set up a login component

Let's set up an Angular standalone component to manage logins and sign ups. We'll use Magic Links, so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.
Create an `AuthComponent` with `ng g c auth --standalone` Angular CLI command.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/auth/auth.component.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/auth/auth.component.ts"
/>

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/auth/auth.component.html"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/auth/auth.component.html"
/>

### Account page

Users also need a way to edit their profile details and manage their accounts after signing in.
Create an `AccountComponent` with the `ng g c account --standalone` Angular CLI command.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/account/account.component.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/account/account.component.ts"
/>

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/account/account.component.html"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/account/account.component.html"
/>

### Launch!

Now that we have all the components in place, let's update `AppComponent` to use our standalone components:

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/app.component.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/app.component.ts"
/>

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/app.component.html"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/app.component.html"
/>

Since we're using Angular 19's standalone components, we need to update `main.ts` to bootstrap our application with the necessary providers:

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/main.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/main.ts"
/>

Once that's done, run this in a terminal window:

```bash
npm run start
```

And then open the browser to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and you should see the completed app.

## Bonus: Profile photos

Every Supabase project is configured with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

### Create an upload widget

Let's create an avatar for the user so that they can upload a profile photo.
Create an `AvatarComponent` with `ng g c avatar --standalone` Angular CLI command.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/avatar/avatar.component.ts"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/avatar/avatar.component.ts"
/>

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/avatar/avatar.component.html"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/app/avatar/avatar.component.html"
/>

## Next steps

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
