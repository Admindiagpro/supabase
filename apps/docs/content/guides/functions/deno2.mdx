## What is Deno 2?

Deno 2 is a major upgrade to the Deno runtime that powers Supabase Edge Functions. It focuses on scalability and seamless ecosystem compatibility while maintaining Deno's core principles of security, simplicity, and developer experience.

**Key improvements include**

- **Node.js and npm compatibility**: Dramatically improved support for npm packages and Node.js code
- **Better dependency management**: New tools like `deno install`, `deno add`, and `deno remove` for simplified package management
- **Improved performance**: Enhanced runtime execution and startup times
- **Workspace and monorepo support**: Better handling of complex project structures
- **Framework compatibility**: Support for Next.js, SvelteKit, Remix, and other popular frameworks
- **Full package.json support**: Works seamlessly with existing Node.js projects and npm workspaces

While these improvements are exciting, they come with some changes that may affect your existing functions. We'll support Deno 1.x functions for a limited time, but we recommend migrating to Deno 2 within the next few months to ensure continued functionality.

## How to use Deno 2

Deno 2 will soon become the default choice for creating new functions. For now, Deno 2 is available in preview mode for local development.

### Enable Deno 2 for existing functions

1. [Install Deno 2.1](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) or newer version on your machine
2. Within your project, open `supabase/config.toml` and set `deno_version = 2`

   ```toml
   [edge_runtime]
   deno_version = 2
   ```

3. All your existing functions should work as before.

---

### Create new functions with Deno 2

1. Within the `functions` folder, scaffold a new function as a Deno 2 project:

   ```bash
   deno init --serve hello-world
   ```

2. Open `supabase/config.toml` and add the following:

   ```toml
   [functions.hello-world]
   entrypoint = "./functions/hello-world/main.ts"
   ```

3. Open `supabase/functions/hello-world/main.ts` and modify line 10 to:

   ```tsx
   if (url.pathname === "/hello-world") {
   ```

4. Run `npx supabase@beta functions serve --no-verify-jwt` to start the dev server.
5. Visit `http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/hello-world`
6. To run built-in tests: `cd supabase/functions/hello-world; deno test`

Now you should have Deno 2 set up and running with your Edge Functions.

## Migrating from Deno 1 to Deno 2

<Admonition type="info">
  For a comprehensive migration guide, see the [official Deno 1.x to 2.x migration
  guide](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/migrate_deprecations/).
</Admonition>

Most Deno 1 Edge Functions will be compatible out of the box with Deno 2, and no action needs to be taken. When we upgrade our hosted runtime, your functions will automatically be deployed on a Deno 2 cluster.

However, for a small number of functions, this may break existing functionality. The most common issue to watch for is that some Deno 1 API calls are incompatible with Deno 2 runtime.

The best way to validate your APIs are up to date is to use `deno lint`, which has [rules to disallow deprecated APIs](https://docs.deno.com/lint/rules/no-deprecated-deno-api/).

```bash
deno lint
```

`Deno.Closer` and `Deno.Buffer` are a couple of such deprecated APIs. Instead, use `Closer` and `Buffer` from the Standard Library:

```tsx
+ import type { Closer } from "jsr:@std/io/types";

// - function foo(closer: Deno.Closer) {}
+ function foo(closer: Closer) {}
```

```tsx
+ import { Buffer } from "jsr:@std/io/buffer";

// - const buffer = new Deno.Buffer();
+ const buffer = new Buffer();
```
